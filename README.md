Hi there, Iâ€™m Alex Barrios(@barrilocho). ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in new technologies, photography, drones and some videogames.

I'm currently enjoying working with Astro, NextJS and deepening my understanding of NestJS, while actively contributing to the development of LeeMexico website. ðŸŒ±

Since 7 years ago, I have been leading and building mobile apps and web apps for some companies and startups (like Universidad de Guadalajara, Arca continental, Treembo, Trippolis and others).
