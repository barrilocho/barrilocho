Hi there, Iâ€™m Alex Barrios(@barrilocho). ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in new technologies, photography, drones and some videogames.

Iâ€™m currently learning Astro, improving nestjs knowledge. ðŸŒ±

Since 7 years ago, I have been leading and building mobile apps and web apps for some companies and startups (like Universidad de Guadalajara, Arca continental, Treembo, Trippolis and others).
